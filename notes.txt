check_input:
	input have to be modified so that the variable gets replace by the actual value#
		input is the entire string
		var start is the beginning from that on it should be cutted
		lets cut say input[var_start] gets null terminated
		then join the value to the input
		then continue with the rest of the string 
		 so we need the end of the value which is input[var_start + ft_strlen(var[0])]
